# react-3d-carousel

## Description

React 3D Carousel component which allows any type of child component as part of
the carousel. Inspired by https://github.com/bobiblazeski/react-3d-carousel but
updated to use JSX, ES6 classs definitions and allow any child component
instead of just img.

This article also heavily influenced my implementation, much credit to:
